<li>What would compel a struggling coal miner in Shropshire to join the controversial new faith of traveling missionaries?</li>
<li>How could a recently widowed father send his 9 year old son to another country with virtual strangers, knowing he may never see him again?</li>
<li>This young boy would grow up to be the respected patriarch of a large family in California. How in the world did he get from Liverpool to San Bernardino, and why?</li>
<br>
<li>And a question I might never find the answer to: Would this father and son ever see each other again?</li>
</ul>
<p>In my quest to discover my ancestorâ€™s story, I found the answers to those questions and many more. This website is a virtual interactive museum exhibit centered around this father/son story, and surrounded by deep dives into elements of the story that may pique your interest. You can start by choosing a narrative: an <strong>essay</strong>, a <strong>report,</strong> or <strong>a brief</strong>. Each includes links to more depth about the <strong>historical events</strong>, the <strong>people</strong>, and the <strong>places </strong>in the story. To <strong>documents</strong>, to <strong>photos</strong>. To <strong>links to sites</strong> where you can discover more. And at any time, you can return to the story just where you left off.</p>
<p>Enjoy learning about my 2<sup>nd</sup> great grandfather, Robert Albert Poppett, and his life among the Mormons.</p>
