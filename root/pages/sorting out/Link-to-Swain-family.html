<p>Swain family</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mary Swain’s mother was <strong>Elizabeth Pugh</strong> (1785-1857)—<em>not sure how Elizabeth links in with the Pugh family, but undoubtedly she was closely related</em>. Her father, Robert, had a brother, <strong>John Swain</strong> 1782-1837, who had a son <strong>Abraham Swain</strong> 1799-1832, who had married Ann Jacks. The widowed <strong>Ann Jacks Swaine</strong> was living next door to RLP in 1851<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Swain/Poppett connections</em></strong></p>
<p>I found no record of RLP divorcing wife <strong>Mary Swain</strong>, nor did she travel with him to America. In 1881 she is a charwoman and lives with her illegitimate daughter Mary and Mary’s illegitimate daughter Elizabeth Ann<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>. The census indicates she is married. In 1885 Mary Poppett, daughter of the deceased Robert Swain, who we know died in 1852, and said to be widowed (although RLP was very much alive), married bachelor William Marston, a general laborer whose father, William Marsten, was a lead miner<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>. Interestingly, Mary’s mother was an <strong>Elizabeth Pugh</strong>, born about 1785 in Worthen, Shropshire; she married Robert Swain in Worthen in 1817<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>. <strong>Mary’s brother George Swain (1843) married RLP’s daughter Elizabeth Poppett</strong> in Montgomeryshire in 1871<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>; George and Elizabeth and family emigrated to Canada in 1887<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>.</p>
