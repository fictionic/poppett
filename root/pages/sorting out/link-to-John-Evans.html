<p>John Evans</p>
<p>Young Robert’s name can be found on the ship’s passenger list next to a <strong>Thomas Davis (Davies?)</strong>, age 33, and near a <strong>John Evans</strong> who had a wife named <strong>Harriett</strong>, each of which is a likely candidate. We will recall that the priest who baptized RLP the first time in Shropshire in 1847 and then again in 1848 was a <strong>John Evans</strong>. Many John Evans’ eventually made the trek to Utah from Council Bluffs, but none that I can find with a Harriett. Perhaps it was she who died?</p>
