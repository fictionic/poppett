<blockquote>
<p><strong>John Cox</strong>, son of William Cox and Elizabeth Turner of Gloucestershire, England, and his wife Eliza Margaret Roberts, whom he had married in 1836 at St Mary’s in Deerhurst, Gloucestershire, England, had their first two daughters in Gloucestershire, but show up on the Nauvoo Tax Index in 1842, so must have been brought into the fold by the first group of missionaries to England in 1841. It was said that John worked on building the temple in Nauvoo. A third daughter was born in 1844 in Nauvoo, but his 4<sup>th</sup> was born late in 1846 in Winter Quarters in Nebraska, after the Saints were expelled from Illinois. While there, John Cox was among the 500 Saints recruited into the Mormon Battalion; he was a private in company E. Their 3 year old daughter died at Winter Quarters in 1847 while their father was away. In 1848 John was with the Jonathan H. Holmes and Samuel Thompson Company of returning battalion soldiers who were diverted to Sutter’s Mill to mine for gold before going to Utah. There is a record of John Cox having donated $30 toward 2 brass cannons they were to take to the LDS church in Utah. Cox got to Utah then went straight on to Pottawattamie to rejoin his family, which is where we find him with Robert Poppett in 1850. Certainly young Robert heard stories of California from this man and other returning Battalion soldiers.</p>
