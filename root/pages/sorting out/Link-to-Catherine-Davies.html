<p>Edward Davies, born 3 Mar 1811 in Hyssington Marsh, Montgomeryshire, Wales, married a woman named <strong>Sarah</strong> J. 1 Jul 1841 at the Church of St. Etheldreda in Hyssington. This is quite possibly the same Edward Davies who baptized RLP into the LDS church. Their children were born in Asterley, Shropshire, England, starting with Mary in 1843, then Edwin Lewis in 1848, the Elizabeth in 1851, who soon died, then daughter Sarah E. about 1854, then <strong>Albert</strong> Edward in 1855. Given these match some of the names and ages of RLP’s traveling companions on the LDS ship to America, this is further reason to believe this is the same Edward Davies. Given that it was an Edwin Lewis in Asterley who RLP entrusted with correspondence, and Edward’s son Edwin lived in Asterley in 1871, this is further support for this long-time family connection.</p>
<p>In 1871 Edward, an engine driver at Colliary, lived in District 6, Pontesbury, Shropshire, with wife Sarah, 16 year old son Albert, a laborer, along with granddaughter Sarah Ann, age 4, and grandson Alfred, 6. Eldest daughter Mary had married <strong>James Evans</strong> in 1864 in Shrewsbury, Shropshire and in 1871 James and Mary lived with an elder Sarah Evans, age 70, and three daughters: Mary Jane, Minnie, and baby Emily. Their children <strong>Sarah Ann and Alfred</strong> lived with Mary’s parents. James was a miner at the Snailbach Colliery, and died in an accident there at age 39 in 1878.</p>
<p><strong>An Edwin Lewis Davies</strong> (1848-1916), son of <strong>Edward Davies</strong> (1811-1890) and Sarah, was born in Asterley and lived there with his wife Elizabeth in 1870; they emigrated from Liverpool to Utah in 1878. (Was Edwin Davis the son of the head of the LDS branch in Shropshire?)</p>
